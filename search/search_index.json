What is NCSI? \u00b6 The NCSI is used within the Network Awareness API and shows the Internet connectivity with the Network Connection Status Icon in the system tray. This mechanism can be configured by registry keys of the \"Network Location Awareness\" service. The internet connectivity is determined by four steps: In the first step, an IPv4 HTTP request is compared to a known string stored in the registry. If the request returns the expected characters, the Internet connection is considered to be available. If the request fails, the same mechanism is used with an IPv6 URL. If both fail, the third step tries to resolve an IPv4 DNS name and, if this fails again, an IPv6 DNS resolution is used. If all four steps fail, then the Internet connection is considered to be not available.
